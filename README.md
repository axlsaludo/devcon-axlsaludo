# devcon-axlsaludo

This project is a fork of the [zero-web](https://github.com/axlsaludo/zero-web) repository, customized and deployed on Web 3 infrastructure. The website is live at: [https://tmdhz-vyaaa-aaaak-qivqq-cai.icp0.io](https://tmdhz-vyaaa-aaaak-qivqq-cai.icp0.io).

## Overview

This website is hosted on the Internet Computer (ICP) using DFINITY's DFX toolkit, which allows for deploying decentralized applications (dApps) on the Web 3 ecosystem. This setup ensures a decentralized, secure, and censorship-resistant hosting environment.

## Features

- **Decentralized Hosting**: The website is hosted on the Internet Computer, ensuring that it is resistant to downtime and censorship.
- **Web 3.0 Ready**: Leveraging blockchain technology, the website benefits from the security, transparency, and robustness of decentralized networks.
- **Built with [zero-web](https://github.com/axlsaludo/zero-web)**: This project started as a fork of the zero-web repository, which has been customized to suit the specific needs of this deployment.

## Deployment on Web 3.0
